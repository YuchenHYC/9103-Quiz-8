2. These two images illustrate the starry sky. By changing color they show the brightness, and by dragging the canvas through mouse, we can discover endless stars.
>
3. After we set up the night mode of Figure 3 from assignment 3, we can add these stars on the sky and the river as the reflection. It would be beautiful.

# **Part 2: Coding technique Exploration**

1. Effect: the following code creates many dots with different colors. These dots are distributed across three layers with random initail colour and positions, and move based on the mouse's position. If a dot moves beyond the canvas boundaries, it reappears from the opposite side, so we have visually endless dots.
>
2. Contribution: the code help us interact with the Figure 3.
